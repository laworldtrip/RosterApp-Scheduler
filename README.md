Problem Statement

As a hotel employee, I noticed that managers often struggle to prepare staff rosters on time. This challenge becomes more complicated because rosters must balance several factors:

Hotel occupancy: staffing levels need to match expected guest numbers.

Employee availability: each staff member has different schedules and restrictions.

Staff types:

Full-time staff usually need priority hours to meet contracts.

Part-time staff require steady allocation but with fewer shifts.

Casual staff need fair distribution (at least one shift each week) without overloading any single person.

These constraints make manual rostering time-consuming, error-prone, and stressful, especially when last-minute changes occur.
